# Perry Park used to be a large slave plantation owned by the Perry family during the time of the civil war.
# It later became a golf course in the late 1960's.
# My father and his family bought the land in the 1990's and have owned and maintained it ever since.
# I have spent countless hours around this land, and it is of great importance to me.
# I hope to give this map of Perry Park along with my other maps to my Dad on Father's Day.
